#### What is the FiveM Resource Project?
This project is something I have been working on for a little while, basically it is a bot that crawls through multiple Discord servers, forums and the whole world wide web searching for files that is related to FiveM.

The bot is currently in a very Work In Progress state, so there will be a lot of duplicate resources and some files might even be locked due to people locking when when sharing them.

The idea with this bot is to create a web interface for it later down the road that lets people search for scripts based on keywords for example: ``Ambulance``, that will then return everything related to that keyword.

#### Whats with the random numbers and characters before a script name?
In order to avoid having files with the same name for example: ``script (1).zip`` I generate a unique short ID for each folder so there are no name conflicts.

#### Will the bot be open sourced?
In the future the whole bot including said web panel will be open sourced when it is in a state where I feel like it is stable and easy to use.

I am NOT responsible for any harm that these resources might cause, I have NOT looked through ANY code of these resources.

It is your responsibility to make sure that anything you download from here is safe to use.
